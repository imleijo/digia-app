# digia-app - installation
This is a small contact memo app for Digia.

How to install:
- locally
	1. Clone the repository and install node_modules via terminal with npm/yarn install(npm was initially used, but yarn also works. Just delete the package-lock to be safe.)
	2. Start the emulator from android studio ADV
	3. In terminal run the project with npx react-native start --reset-cache or npx react-native run-android

- on device
	1. Follow this link to download the apk file and run it in your android device https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D_qh1-MoXINSrVPHpTmzaNPQNkTA5kPB/view?usp=sharing
	
- on web
	1. Follow this link to a host service https://appetize.io/app/x03uy4pthzj2bhpp9rucz837v8
	2. Select an Android emulator and press 'Tap to play'
	(Hosted emulators tend to be slow and their sizes vary. It is recommended to use a large device for best user experience.)
	
	
	Disclaimer!
	The original assignment was meant to be done with React, but upon discussing the matter with the recruiter, it was agreed to be done with React Native.
	Keeping in mind mobile UX works quite differently from web, I took the liberty of making edits to the work assignment and implemented them for better UX.
	
	Thanks you.
	BR, Leo
